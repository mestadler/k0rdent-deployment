# Deploy beach-head services on Management Cluster itself

To deploy beach-head services on the management cluster, a MultiClusterService object can be created with `.spec.serviceSpec.provider.selfManagement=true` as shown below: 

```yaml
apiVersion: k0rdent.mirantis.com/v1beta1
kind: MultiClusterService
metadata:
  name: mgmt-mcs
spec:
  serviceSpec:
    provider:
      name: ksm-projectsveltos
      selfManagement: true
    services:
      - template: ingress-nginx-4-11-3
        name: ingress-nginx
        namespace: ingress-nginx
```

This will create a ServiceSet which will also have `.spec.serviceSpec.provider.selfManagement=true`, which in-turn will indicate to the KSM [StateManagementProvider](ksm-providers.md) that this MCS is supposed to match the management cluster itself. 

The default StateManagementProvider is Sveltos, so there is a object named mgmt in the mgmt namespace of the cluster where k0rdent has been installed. This object represents the management cluster itself, and is different from the default k0rdent namespace such as `kcm-system`. To view this object run:

```sh
kubectl -n mgmt get sveltoscluster mgmt --show-labels
```

The output should be similar to this:

```sh
NAME   READY   VERSION   LABELS
mgmt   true    v1.32.2   k0rdent.mirantis.com/management-cluster=true,projectsveltos.io/k8s-version=v1.32.2,sveltos-agent=present
```

Any number of ServiceTemplates (ingress-nginx-4-11-3 in this example) can be added to the MultiClusterService's `.spec.serviceSpec.services` field. See [Using and Creating ServiceTemplates](./ksm-service-templates.md) for how to create ServiceTemplates.

To verify that the ingress-nginx-4-11-3 beach-head service was sucessfully deployed, the status of the MultiClusterService can be queried with:

```sh
kubectl get multiclusterservice mgmt -o yaml
```

The output should be similar to the following showing that ingress-nginx has been Provisioned:

```yaml
apiVersion: k0rdent.mirantis.com/v1beta1
kind: MultiClusterService
metadata: {}
spec: {}
